Beacon Scanner is a powerful utility for detecting and monitoring iBeacon devices from your Mac.

SCAN FOR NEARBY BEACONS
Instantly detect all iBeacon devices broadcasting within Bluetooth range. Beacon Scanner continuously monitors for new beacons and displays them in real-time as they appear.

DETAILED BEACON INFORMATION
View comprehensive details for each detected beacon:
• Proximity UUID - The unique identifier for the beacon
• Major & Minor values - Used for beacon identification and grouping
• RSSI signal strength - Monitor signal quality in real-time
• Last update timestamp - Track when each beacon was last seen

REAL-TIME MONITORING
Watch as beacon data updates live. Signal strength and timestamps refresh continuously, giving you an accurate picture of the Bluetooth environment around you.

SIMPLE & INTUITIVE
Start scanning with a single click. The clean, native macOS interface makes it easy to monitor beacons without any complex setup.

PERFECT FOR DEVELOPERS & TESTERS
• Test your iBeacon deployments
• Verify beacon configurations
• Debug proximity-based applications
• Monitor beacon signal coverage

BUILT FOR macOS
Beacon Scanner is a native macOS application designed to integrate seamlessly with your Mac. It uses Core Bluetooth for reliable, low-energy beacon detection.

WHAT ARE iBEACONS?
iBeacons are small Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transmitters that broadcast a unique identifier. They're used for indoor positioning, proximity marketing, asset tracking, and location-aware applications. While iOS has built-in iBeacon support, macOS previously lacked scanning utilities — Beacon Scanner fills that gap.

REQUIREMENTS
• macOS 10.13 or later
• Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) support
• No additional hardware required
